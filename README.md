# 3DMandlebrotSetVisualization
3D projection of the mandlebrot set.

Complex numbers can be extended to 4 dimensions in the form of quaternions.

The madlebrot set shows convergin/diverging points for a simple complex quadratic function.

We can then extend the mandlebrot set to 4 dimensions, and project it back into 3 dimensions to get an idea for the shape of the fractal.

This visualization showcases that fractal in a 3D environment that you can move around in and explore the fractal geometry.
